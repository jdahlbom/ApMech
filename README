README and instructions for building APMech for different platforms


OS X:

You need to create symbolic link in Ogre and CEGUI framework 
header folders. This is because otherwise includes to files such 
as Ogre/OgrePrerequisites.h don't work. This is done for instance 
by saying in the Ogre framework "Headers" directory: "ln -s . Ogre"

Start compilation by saying "scons ogre='/path/to/OgreSDK'". 
After compilation, you currently need to manually copy the 
necessary frameworks (Ogre, CEGUI, OgreCEGUIRendeder) to the 
Contents/Frameworks directory in the application bundle.
