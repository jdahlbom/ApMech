README and instructions for building APMech for different platforms

./autogen.sh
automake --add-missing ## May or may not be needed
./configure
make
Do not make install, unless you want apmech executables in /usr/local/bin

OS X:

You need to create symbolic link in Ogre and CEGUI framework 
header folders. This is because otherwise includes to files such 
as Ogre/OgrePrerequisites.h don't work. This is done for instance 
by saying in the Ogre framework "Headers" directory: "ln -s . Ogre"

Start compilation by saying "scons ogre='/path/to/OgreSDK'". 
After compilation, you currently need to manually copy the 
necessary frameworks (Ogre, CEGUI, OgreCEGUIRendeder) to the 
Contents/Frameworks directory in the application bundle.

Windows:

You can try with MinGW but it is not really supported in any way.
Best bet would be building your own vcproj file and compiling from that.
